# Deep Learning Model for Predicting Accuracy in Dot Pattern Categories

This notebook outlines the steps to build and evaluate a deep learning model for predicting the accuracy of responses to new dot pattern categories, based on the distance of these patterns from their prototypes.

## Setup

First, import the necessary libraries.

```python
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean
```

## Data Preprocessing

Load the dataset and preprocess it by calculating the distance from each item to its prototype.

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Extracting prototypes
prototypes = data[data['Pattern_Token'] == 'prototype']

# Function to calculate distance from prototype
def calculate_distance_from_prototype(item, prototypes):
    subject = item['sbjCode']
    category = item['Category']
    prototype = prototypes[(prototypes['sbjCode'] == subject) & (prototypes['Category'] == category)]
    if prototype.empty:
        return np.nan
    item_coords = item.iloc[7:25].values.flatten()
    prototype_coords = prototype.iloc[0][7:25].values.flatten()
    return euclidean(item_coords, prototype_coords)

# Calculate distances for new items
new_items = data[data['Pattern_Token'].isin(['new_low', 'new_med', 'new_high'])]
new_items['distance_from_prototype'] = new_items.apply(lambda item: calculate_distance_from_prototype(item, prototypes), axis=1)

# Prepare features and target variable
features = new_items[['distance_from_prototype']]
target = new_items['Corr']

# Splitting the data
train_features, test_features, train_target, test_target = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, stratify=new_items['sbjCode'])
```

## Model Building

Define and compile the neural network model.

```python
def build_model():
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
        Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

model = build_model()
```

## Model Training

Train the model using the training data.

```python
history = model.fit(train_features, train_target, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)
```

## Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

```python
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_features, test_target)
print("Test Accuracy: ", test_accuracy)
```

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a basic framework for building and evaluating a deep learning model for the given task. Adjustments and improvements can be made based on the specific requirements and results obtained.
