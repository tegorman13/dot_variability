**Notes:**

- **REP:** Repeating Protocol
- **NREP:** Nonrepeating Protocol
- **Hu & Nosofsky (2022)** investigated the effects of repeating vs. nonrepeating training patterns on category learning and generalization.
- **Hu & Nosofsky (2024)** examined the impact of different training distortion levels on category learning and generalization.
- The **Fixed Prototype Pilot Study** aimed to understand how training pattern variability influences classification learning and generalization using fixed prototypes. 
- All studies used a dot pattern categorization paradigm where participants learned to classify patterns into categories based on visual similarity.
- Dot pattern distortions were created using a modified Posner-Keele (1968) procedure. Low, medium and high distortions displaced the dots by an average of 4, 6, and 7.7 Posner-levels respectively.

**Notes:**

* **Hu & Nosofsky (2024)** examined the impact of different training distortion levels on category learning and generalization.
* The **Fixed Prototype Pilot Study** aimed to understand how training pattern variability influences classification learning and generalization using fixed prototypes. 
* All studies used a dot pattern categorization paradigm where participants learned to classify patterns into categories based on visual similarity.
* "Posner" refers to the Posner & Keele (1968) statistical distortion algorithm used to create variations of prototype patterns.
